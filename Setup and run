Open Terminal on Mac; if you are working on Windows then you can do it using Power shell. Then navigate to the working directory (e.g.) desktop write get clone and paste the link of my repo then it will clone the repo on your desktop. Now navigate inside the directory chat app and open it on your code editor. Now we need to install the npm packages run npm.cmd i on your terminal so after you have installed all the packages it's now time to run this application for this you just need to write npm Run start at the terminal and this is going to start the development server and the application has been started.
